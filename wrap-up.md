## Questions

### Please provide instructions on how to run your project in a bulleted list below.

- Start up Docker Desktop, then from the root directory, run `docker-compose up -d`.
- Run `npm install` in the root directory (Assuming you have Node on your machine).
- Run `npm install` again in /front-end.
- Run `npm install` again in /back-end - I would simplify this into a single project as a nice-to-have.
- With that process finished, go to /back-end and run `npm run start`
- In another terminal, go to /front-end and run `npm run dev`
- Attempt to enjoy the process of using the ATM.

### Were there any pieces of this project that you were not able to complete that you'd like to mention?

- Not really, obviously I've been working on this a long time so all of the most basic stuff functions as desired. I wish I had more proficiency in MUI so it looked more polished.

- A massive amount of my effort on this was spent learning all the complexity of setting up a project up from scratch, which I hadn't done before. Trying different libraries for migrations (including setting up all of their configurations, which often involved additional libraries), different UI styling options, realizing I could do things more simply by modifying the database initialization file only after struggling through JS migrations libraries, etc.

### If you were to continue building this out, what would you like to add next?

- I'd add a separate interface for credit accounts, make the page have a nice looking UI element in place to show the current account number, probably add the ability to log in to your account, maybe some fun graphics of money going in or coming out of a slot, etc.
- As an attendum to the above, I had a UX/UI developer look at this assignment and he thought it would be fun to make a mock ATM touchscreen, so I'd try to do something like that.
- As mentioned above, I'd combine these projects into a single one as far as dependencies and scripts go

### If you have any other comments or info you'd like the reviewers to know, please add them below.

- This was a very valuable learning exercise, helping me brush up on the low-level setup basics. Also I thrive best working on a team, so it was a challenge to keep going on this when it was completely by myself, but now I'm more comfortable doing it than I was before. I'd never done a full project like this completely alone before!
